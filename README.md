## My process

<code>
for (let coffee = 1; project != done; coffee++) {
  if (LiquidDnBPlaylist) {
    return play
  }
}
<code>

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Javascript
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Pseudo elements and selectors

### What I learned

CSS grid feels a bit better, still lots of room to improve... also not sure why the breakpoints look fine
on Firefox, but when on Chrome they get messed up going under 375px width.. :/
